The given default neural networks were used. It consists of three linear layers with 64


# A plot of rewards

![Plot_score][image2]

A plot of rewards per episode is included to illustrate that the agent is able to receive an average reward (over 100 episodes) of at least +13. In order for the environment to achieve at least score of 13, 434 episodes was needed to solve the environment.


# Ideas for Future Work

In order to improve the agent's performance (less number of episodes to be explored to achieve the same score of 13 or more), the following ideas are considered:
